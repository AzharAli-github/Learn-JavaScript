    <br> The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:
    <li>The HTML elements as objects</li>
    <li>The properties of all HTML elements</li>
    <li>The methods to access all HTML elements</li>
    <li>The events for all HTML elements</li>
    The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
    <li>Core DOM - standard model for all document types</li>
    <li>XML DOM - standard model for XML documents</li>
    <li>HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents
    </li>
